Jun 8, 8:48 AM&Hands-on-Machine-Learning&Chapter 10. Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras - From Biological to Artificial Neurons - The Perceptron&&The Perceptron is one of the simplest ANN architectures, invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt. It is based on a slightly different artificial neuron (see Figure 10-4) called From Biological to Artificial Neurons | 281&281&0
Jun 8, 8:54 AM&Hands-on-Machine-Learning&Chapter 10. Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras - From Biological to Artificial Neurons - The Perceptron&&(or Hebbian learning); that is, the connection weight between two neurons is increased whenever they have the same output.&281&1
Jun 8, 8:54 AM&Hands-on-Machine-Learning&Chapter 10. Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks with Keras - From Biological to Artificial Neurons - The Perceptron&&Note that contrary to Logistic Regression classifiers, Perceptrons do not output a class probability; rather, they just make predictions based on a hard threshold.&282&1
